## Project Name: Let's Learn Chinese (React)
This is the same website I have previously created but this time it was made using React.

*A website for learning basic Chinese. Users can listen to audio and follow along with the text. A translation and pronunciation guide can be revealed by clicking on a button. A 'test your knowledge' section at the bottom allows users to test their knowledge and then click or tap to reveal the answer. There are currently lessons for five different topics.*

## Motivation
I wanted to learn React.

## Tech used
- React

## Project features
- same as previous version
  - *embedded audio*
  - *reveal and hide translation and pronunciation guide*
  - *word translation table*
  - *knowledge test table*
  - *dark theme*
  - *fully responsive web design*
  - *concealed pop-out menu*

## Lessons learnt
- fundamentals of React

## future development
- As with the previous version of this website there are many features that could be added
  - *there is currently no footer section*
  - *more lessons could be added*
  - *I could consult other language learning websites for features this website lacks*
- I could expand this to be more complex and increase my understanding of React

## How to use
Website is not currently live.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
